### How to Compile

#### 1. Using TurboC

Turbo C is a discontinued integrated development environment and compiler for the C programming language, and its offical website is unknown

#### 2. Online Compilers

There are many free online sites that can be used to compile C programs like [gdb compiler](https://www.onlinegdb.com/online_c_compiler) and [programiz](https://www.programiz.com/c-programming/online-compiler/)

#### 3. Linux OS [Ubuntu]

gcc compiler can compile and run C files, here are the steps

1. Open the terminal

2. `cd Desktop/` - change working directory

3. `touch hello.c` - create a file named 'hello.c' on desktop

4. Edit the `hello.c` file

5. `gcc hello.c -o out` - compile the 'hello.c' file in out [add `-lm` after in case `<math.h>` is used]

6. `./out` - run c file

**Note:** Everytime the `.c` File is edited and saved it needs to be recompiled.

#### 4. VS Code [Recommended]

- VS code is an IDE which can compile C with CodeRunner Extension
- Install VS code - https://code.visualstudio.com/download
- [Linux/mac] Install code runner Extension after installing VS code from [here](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=formulahendry.code-runner)
- If you are on windows refer to this [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oaebkkOP2Qg)
